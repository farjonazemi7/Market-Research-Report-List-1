<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radar Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pulsed Radar</li><li>Continuous Wave (CW) Radar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The radar systems market features two primary types: Pulsed Radar and Continuous Wave (CW) Radar. Pulsed Radar emits short bursts of energy, measuring the time it takes for the pulse to return, making it effective for long-range detection and targets in motion. In contrast, CW Radar continuously transmits signals, allowing for better measurement of target speed and distance without the need for pulse timing. Both systems serve various applications in aviation, defense, automotive, and weather monitoring sectors.</p></p>
